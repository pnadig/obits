## Special Thanks

Like most software Obits was built with many dependencies. I'd like to give a special shout-out to
the team at Improbable responsible for gRPC web, github.com/budiadiono for the Vue-typed library, and 
github.com/olivere for his wonderful Elasticsearch client library for Golang from which elastic-gopher was built.
